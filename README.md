* Search - The tool can run any searches on the keywords provided. It can search movies, tv shows, person, etc. It will only display items that are fully prepared for viewers with all information already uploaded. Simplified search functions will improve user experience.

* Detail information - Clicking a single movie or tv show will load the page about the item chosen. There's information on the genre, year released, rating, and total votes. Total votes are included to help pin point the greatest shows from the popular ones.
